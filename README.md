# Landing Page Project
I convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This required a modification in the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.
# The functionalities:
- The Navigation
a loop was made through the number of implemented sections and generate an area in the header for each one.
- The dynamic active
it allows the header to show which section is currently "active" in the page.
- The scrolling effect
This file listens for clicks on the navigation and then scrolls the page to the appropriate section header.
